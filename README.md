# otel-tui

A terminal OpenTelemetry viewer inspired by [otel-desktop-viewer](https://github.com/CtrlSpice/otel-desktop-viewer/tree/main).

This tool currently supports OpenTelemetry, Zipkin (Traces) and Prometheus (Metrics) formats.

## Getting Started

Currently, this tool exposes the ports:

- `4317` to receive OpenTelemetry signals (gRPC)
- `4318` to receive OpenTelemetry signals (HTTP)
- `9411` to receive Zipkin traces (enabled by `--enable-zipkin` option)

The server's Access-Control-Allow-Origin header includes `localhost`, allowing telemetry to be sent directly from browser applications running on localhost.

Options:

```
Usage:
  otel-tui [flags]

Flags:
      --debug-log                 Enable debug log output to file (/tmp/otel-tui.log)
      --enable-zipkin             Enable the zipkin receiver
      --from-json-file string     The JSON file path exported by JSON exporter
      --grpc int                  The port number on which we listen for OTLP grpc payloads (default 4317)
  -h, --help                      help for otel-tui
      --host string               The host where we expose our OTLP endpoints (default "0.0.0.0")
      --http int                  The port number on which we listen for OTLP http payloads (default 4318)
      --prom-target stringArray   Enable the prometheus receiver and specify the target endpoints for the receiver (--prom-target "localhost:9000" --prom-target "http://other-host:9000/custom/prometheus")
  -v, --version                   version for otel-tui
```

### Homebrew

```sh
$ brew install ymtdzzz/tap/otel-tui
```

### go install

```sh
$ go install github.com/ymtdzzz/otel-tui@latest
```

### Docker

Run in the container simply:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it --name otel-tui ymtdzzz/otel-tui:latest
```

Or, run as a background process and attach it:

```sh
# Run otel-tui as a background process
$ docker run --rm -dit --name otel-tui ymtdzzz/otel-tui:latest

# Show TUI in your current terminal session
$ docker attach otel-tui

# Detach by pressing Ctrl+p -> Ctrl+q
```

### Docker Compose

First, add service to your manifest (`docker-compose.yaml`) for the instrumanted app

```yml
oteltui:
  image: ymtdzzz/otel-tui:latest
  container_name: otel-tui
  stdin_open: true
  tty: true
  # Override entrypoint if you want use options
  entrypoint: ["/otel-tui", "--enable-zipkin"]
```

Modify configuration for otelcol

```yml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: oteltui:4317
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Run as a background process and attach it:

```sh
# Run services as usual
$ docker compose up -d

# Show TUI in your current terminal session
$ docker compose attach oteltui

# Detach by pressing Ctrl+p -> Ctrl+q
```

### Nix

```
nix develop github:ymtdzzz/otel-tui
```

### Executable Binary from Github Release page

https://github.com/ymtdzzz/otel-tui/releases

### From Source

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ymtdzzz/otel-tui.git
$ cd otel-tui
$ go run ./...
```

### Clipboard Functionality Requirements

The clipboard feature (`y` key to copy log body) requires platform-specific tools:

- **Linux/Unix**: Install `xclip` or `xsel` command
- **macOS**: No additional tools required
- **Windows**: No additional tools required

**Note**: If clipboard tools are not available, the application will run normally but clipboard functionality will be disabled.
